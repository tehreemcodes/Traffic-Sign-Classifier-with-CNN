# Traffic-Sign-Classifier-with-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of road signs. It's a critical component in the development of autonomous vehicles, enabling them to detect and interpret traffic signs such as stop signs, speed limits, and yield signsâ€”ensuring safety and lawful decision-making on the road.
